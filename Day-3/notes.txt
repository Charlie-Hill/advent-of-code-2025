Enter a vast lobby, all elevators have red light above them. Escelator has no power.

There are batteries nearby that can supply power, batteries are labelled with their joltage rating (1-9)

Batteries are arranged into banks, each line of digits in your input corresponds to a single bank

Within each bank, you need to turn on exactly two batteries. Joltage that the bank produces is equal to the number formed by digits on batteries youve turned on

E.g. if you have bank `12345` and you turn on batteries `2` and `4` the bank would produce 24 jolts

Find the largest possible joltage each bank can produce

Total output is the sum of maximum joltage from each bank

PART TWO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Escelator doesnt move. Need more joltage. 

Must make largest joltage by turning on EXACTLY TWELVE batteries within bank

Joltage output is still the number formed by the digits of batteries turned on. Only difference is there will now be 12 digits instead of 2.

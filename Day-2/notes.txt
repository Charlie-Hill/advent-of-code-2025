Next stop is the Gift Shop. Clerk asks for help.

Younger elves managed to add a load of invalid product IDs to their DB

Need to check a selection of product ID ranges:

Ranges are separated by COMMA (,)

Each range gives FIRST ID and LAST ID separated by a DASH (-)

11-22,95-115 etc.

Elf was only entering random patterns. 

Identify invalid IDs  by lookking for anything only made by a sequence of digits repeated twice
(55 = 5 repeated twice) (6464 = 64 twice) (123123 = 123 twice)

None of the numbers have leading zeroes; 0101 isnt an ID at all but 101 is a valid ID you would ignore

Your job is to find all invalid IDs that appear in given ranges

PART 1 = add up all INVALID IDS and provide number

PART 2 = Now an ID is invalid if it is only made up of some sequence of digits repeated AT LEAST twice
12341234 = 1234 two times

123123123 = 123 three times

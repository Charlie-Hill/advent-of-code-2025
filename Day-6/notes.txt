Fallen down garbage chute. Approached by family of cephalopods. They think they can get door open but need help with math homework.

Math consists of a list of problems. Each problem has a group of numbers that either needs to be ADDED (+) or MULTIPLIED (*).

However, problems are arranged strangely. Presented next to each other in a long horizontal list.

```
123 328  51 64 
 45 64  387 23 
  6 98  215 314
*   +   *   +  
```

Each problem's numbers are arranged vertically. At the bottom of the problem is a symbol for the operation that needs to be performed.

Problems are separated with a full column of only spaces. Left/right alignment of numbers within each problem can be ignored.

So, this worksheet contains four problems:

123 * 45 * 6 = 33210
328 + 64 + 98 = 490
51 * 387 * 215 = 4243455
64 + 23 + 314 = 401

Solve the GRAND TOTAL found by adding together the answers to each individual problems.

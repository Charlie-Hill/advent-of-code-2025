# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for **[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/)**.  


Due to copyright rules the puzzle input hasn't been provided (some test inputs have).

You can paste your own puzzle input into `inputs.txt` in each Day folder to run the test with the proper puzzle data.

## Tech Stack

I used JavaScript for each puzzle solution. It should be executed with Node.JS as the standard `fs` library is required for reading input text files.

## Disclaimer

All solutions are my own and zero AI tools were used when creating them as I believe using them would've defeated the point of the exercise.

There are probably far more efficient solutions, my goal was to architect something with a view on writing readable code that another programmer can pick up and parse quickly.
